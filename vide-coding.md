# Tweet and Summary: Teach Your AI to Think Like a Senior Engineer

## Tweet

🚀 Stop jumping straight to code! New article shows how to teach AI to think like a senior engineer: plan first, research in parallel, use specialist agents & automated reviews. The result? Ship faster, catch bugs before coding, and build compounding intelligence. Open-sourced on GitHub!

## 10-Line Summary

1. **Plan Before Coding**: Making AI plan before coding leads to faster shipping than jumping straight into implementation.

2. **Parallel Research Operations**: Five agents researching in parallel is much faster than human step-by-step planning, with humans providing taste, judgment, and product context.

3. **Specialist Agents**: Create domain-specific agents like "@event-tracking-expert" that distill everything about particular aspects of your codebase.

4. **Prevent Reinvention**: Search the codebase first to extend existing patterns instead of creating new ones from scratch.

5. **Source Code Reading**: Have agents read library source code directly when documentation lags behind updates, ensuring access to latest features.

6. **Three Automated Review Agents**: Automatically flag over-engineering, check for security vulnerabilities (like SQL injection), and enforce personal coding preferences.

7. **Compounding Intelligence**: The system accumulates your taste over time—every "I don't like this" or "Good catch" makes it smarter.

8. **Real-World Impact**: Example case caught critical issues (Gmail rate limits at 2,000 emails, timeout problems) before any code was written.

9. **Decision-Making Framework**: Agents bring findings, humans make decisions, then collaborate to combine everything into one coherent plan.

10. **Open Source**: The complete planning system is available on Every's GitHub marketplace and can be installed in Claude Code with working /plan commands.
