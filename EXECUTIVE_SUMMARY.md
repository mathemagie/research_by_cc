## Conclusion

Spatial intelligence represents the next frontier in AI, with profound implications for education. The technology is moving rapidly from research labs to classrooms, with proven benefits in learning outcomes, engagement, and skill development. However, realizing the full potential requires:

- **Collaborative innovation** across technology, education, and policy sectors
- **Equity-focused design** ensuring benefits reach all learners
- **Evidence-based implementation** guided by rigorous research
- **Ethical frameworks** protecting student privacy and agency

The question is no longer *whether* AI-generated virtual worlds will transform education, but *how quickly and equitably* we can harness their potential. With deliberate attention to challenges and opportunities, the next five years could see immersive, personalized, spatial learning become the norm rather than the exception.

**The future of education is spatial, immersive, and personalized—and that future is arriving now.**
